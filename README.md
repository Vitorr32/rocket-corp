## The Rocket Corporation Landing Page
Hello there, this project was made with React.js and Redux so that I could add to my portfolio.

The Rocket Corporation (ficticious) is an private company specialized in rocket engineering and production.

The site counts with an functional, responsive and animated front-end that can even route to differents parts of the page.

I want so say thanks for the creators of the components that I utilized for this project: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com),
[Animated CSS for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-animated-css), [Negomi's burguer menu](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu),
[Responsive Redux states](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/redux-responsive), [WOW animation reveal](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW)
and the [Social media icons of Sebastiano Guerreiro](https://dribbble.com/shots/2089345-Nucleo-Free-Social-Icons).

Hope you liked the design, any suggestions or critiques are welcome, of course the site is under the MIT license and can
be user for whatever you want.

# Content
This is a text-based web-application, the user is only an reader and can interact with the side in some points.

The first on the slides session, where it is apresented one to three slides and the user can navigate between then with
the arrows at each side.

The content of the slides is stored in the [My Json Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/vitorr32/rocket-corp), and
are properly fetched before being rendered.

Another one is by the menu, but there's only two routes, the 'About us' and 'Home'.

# Objective
This was made mainly so that I can prove my capabilities in developing responsive and good-looking sites using React.js and Redux.

Hope you liked it.
